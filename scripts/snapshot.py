"""tx-county-watch — snapshot pipeline.

Drives fetch -> normalize -> write 3 artifacts (page.html, page.txt, meta.json)
for every row in manifest/targets.csv, then makes ONE git commit per run.

Fetch strategy is plain-first, escalate-on-empty:
  1. plain HTTP via httpx (realistic UA, follow redirects)
  2. if the cleaned page looks like an empty JS shell -> escalate to headless
  3. headless render via Playwright/Chromium, wait for network idle, grab the DOM

Determinism is sacred: page.html / page.txt must be byte-identical across runs
when the site has not changed. The volatile timestamp lives ONLY in meta.json.

Usage:
    python scripts/snapshot.py                 # all targets, then git commit
    python scripts/snapshot.py --no-commit     # write artifacts, skip commit
    python scripts/snapshot.py --county harris  # one county (repeatable)
    python scripts/snapshot.py --county harris --page-type results
    python scripts/snapshot.py --no-headless   # never escalate (debug/offline)
