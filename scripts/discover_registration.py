"""Discover each county's voter-registration page and add it to the manifest.

    python scripts/discover_registration.py                 # crawl -> draft CSV
    python scripts/discover_registration.py --county Leon
    python scripts/discover_registration.py --append        # draft -> targets.csv

A sixth page type, added after the other five were already established and
snapshotting. It is a separate script rather than a re-run of
discover_pages.py for one reason: re-running full discovery would re-pick all
five existing types, and a scoring tweak made for registration would silently
churn targets that have been stable and hand-audited for months. This crawls
for one type and appends; nothing already in targets.csv is touched.

Why the type was added. The non-citizen-voting flag (noncitizen.py) watches
for language that lives on eligibility and registration pages. Of the five
original page types, none is where a county would write "you must provide
proof of citizenship" -- so the flag could have sat at false forever without
that meaning anything. This is the page type that makes it answerable.

Discovery starts from the homepage and the already-verified elections landing
page, since registration is normally one click from either. Texas splits the work: the Tax
Assessor-Collector is the voter registrar in most counties, so the page often
lives on a tax office that also registers motor vehicles. The scoring weights
in discover_pages.py exist mostly to keep this crawl off vehicle renewals.
A GAP is a finding -- the county publishes no registration page of its own --
and not a discovery failure to paper over.
